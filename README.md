literally a to do list.

When you run the file, you will be prompted with a couple of options; make sure to insert a number. 

The file will keep running as long as you keep inserting numbers. 

When you wish to finish, make sure to enter the number that says exit - this will break the code and end it.

@mirivera3 and I did this prohect.
